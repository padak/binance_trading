Below is some context about the _request_options issue and how to fix it given that you’re on python-binance==1.0.19.

Why This Error Happens
In older versions of python-binance (synchronous client), there was a private attribute called self._request_options, sometimes used to override parameters like recvWindow.
In newer versions and in the async client, _request_options may not exist, so doing:
```
client._request_options['recvWindow'] = 60000
```
will raise:
```
AttributeError: 'AsyncClient' object has no attribute '_request_options'
```

How to Fix

1) Remove client._request_options usage
Simply remove the line:
```
client._request_options['recvWindow'] = 60000
```

from your code. This is the simplest fix if you do not actually need a custom recvWindow.

2) If you truly need a larger recvWindow, specify it in each API call
If you have latency issues or a specific need for a larger recvWindow, you can pass recvWindow for each call that needs it. For example:
```
order = await client.create_order(
    symbol="TRUMPUSDC",
    side=SIDE_BUY,
    type=ORDER_TYPE_LIMIT,
    timeInForce=TIME_IN_FORCE_GTC,
    quantity="10",
    price="0.75",
    recvWindow=60000  # <--- pass it here
)
```
```
order_status = await client.get_order(
    symbol="TRUMPUSDC",
    orderId=123456789,
    recvWindow=60000  # <--- pass it here
)
```
You would do the same for other calls like get_open_orders(), cancel_order(), etc., if you need the longer recvWindow for them.


3) Check if passing options={"recvWindow": 60000} is supported in AsyncClient.create()

Some versions of python-binance (especially the async client) allow you to do:
```
client = await AsyncClient.create(
    api_key=api_key,
    api_secret=api_secret,
    options={"recvWindow": 60000}
)
```
But if your specific version (python-binance==1.0.19) does not support that, you’ll see an error like:

```
TypeError: create() got an unexpected keyword argument 'options'
```

If that happens, your only option is to pass recvWindow in each API call as shown in step 2.

Example Code Snippet

Here’s a stripped-down version of your script that removes _request_options and passes recvWindow in the order placement call:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import asyncio
import logging
import os
from decimal import Decimal
from binance import AsyncClient
from binance.enums import *

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

async def run_single_cycle():
    client = None
    try:
        api_key = os.getenv("BINANCE_TRADE_API_KEY")
        api_secret = os.getenv("BINANCE_TRADE_API_SECRET")

        # 1. Create the AsyncClient WITHOUT referencing _request_options
        client = await AsyncClient.create(
            api_key=api_key,
            api_secret=api_secret
            # If your version supports it, you can try:
            # options={"recvWindow": 60000}
        )

        # 2. Example of placing a limit BUY order with a custom recvWindow
        price = Decimal("0.75")
        quantity = Decimal("10")
        order = await client.create_order(
            symbol="TRUMPUSDC",
            side=SIDE_BUY,
            type=ORDER_TYPE_LIMIT,
            timeInForce=TIME_IN_FORCE_GTC,
            quantity=str(quantity),
            price=str(price),
            recvWindow=60000  # pass it here
        )
        logger.info(f"BUY order placed: {order}")

        # 3. If you want to check the order status
        order_status = await client.get_order(
            symbol="TRUMPUSDC",
            orderId=order["orderId"],
            recvWindow=60000  # pass it here
        )
        logger.info(f"Order status: {order_status}")

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during trading cycle: {e}")
        raise
    finally:
        if client:
            try:
                await client.close_connection()
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Error closing client connection: {e}")

async def main():
    await run_single_cycle()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
That’s it! This will avoid the AttributeError and still allow you to specify a custom recvWindow in each API call if you need it.
