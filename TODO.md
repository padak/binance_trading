## WebSocket Integration
- Implement real-time order status monitoring using Binance WebSocket API
- Features to implement:
  * Connect to Binance user data stream
  * Monitor order execution status
  * Send desktop notifications when orders are filled
  * Option to automatically place follow-up orders (e.g., sell order after buy is filled)
  * Real-time price alerts

### Technical Details
```python
# Example WebSocket implementation:
from binance.websockets import BinanceSocketManager
from binance.client import Client

def order_update_callback(msg):
    """Handle order updates"""
    if msg['e'] == 'executionReport':
        if msg['X'] == 'FILLED':  # Order filled
            send_notification(f"Order {msg['i']} filled at {msg['p']}")
            if msg['S'] == 'BUY':  # If it was a buy order
                place_sell_order(msg)  # Place corresponding sell order

def implement_websocket():
    bm = BinanceSocketManager(client)
    # Start user data stream
    bm.start_user_socket(order_update_callback)
    bm.start()
```

### Required Dependencies
- `python-binance` with WebSocket support
- Desktop notification library (platform specific)
- Secure storage for maintaining WebSocket connection

### Security Considerations
- Ensure secure WebSocket connection
- Handle connection drops and reconnection
- Validate all incoming data
- Store user preferences securely

   - Multiple alert conditions (above/below/crossing)

2. Advanced Order Types

   - Trailing stop orders
   - DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) orders

3. Portfolio Analytics

   - Position sizing recommendations
   - Risk management calculations

4. Enhanced AI Features
